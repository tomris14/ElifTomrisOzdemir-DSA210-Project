# From Seoul to Home: A Walking Habit Analysis Project Proposal
# Problem Statement
During my exchange in South Korea, I developed a routine of tracking my monthly walking distances using the Apple Health app. This habit had a profoundly positive impact on both my physical and mental well-being. Now that I have returned to Turkey, I want to evaluate how my current walking patterns compare to those during my time in South Korea. By identifying these differences, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of changes in my activity levels and discover ways to enhance my lifestyle for improved health and fitness.

# How Will We Address This Problem and Data Information
To explore this, I will analyze two sets of walking data: one from my time in South Korea and the other from my current routine in Turkey. I used the Apple Health app to record my activity during the exchange program and will continue using it for consistency. This ensures that the data metrics are directly comparable.

I will begin by exporting historical walking data from the Apple Health app, covering the months spent in South Korea. Then, I will collect daily walking data using the same app over the project period. These datasets will serve as the foundation for a detailed comparison of my walking habits during these two life phases.

# Methods and Tools We Plan to Use
The analysis will commence with data cleaning and preparation to ensure consistency across both datasets. I will use Python for this phase, leveraging libraries like pandas for data manipulation and formatting. Following this, I will conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and distributions in my walking habits. Statistical methods will help reveal significant differences and trends between the datasets. Additionally, I will create visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to present findings clearly and impactfully. The entire process will be organized and documented in Jupyter Notebook, with project files managed and shared via GitHub.

# Expected Outcome
The project is expected to result in a comprehensive comparison of my walking habits during my South Korean exchange program and my current daily routine in Turkey. Through analysis, I aim to uncover insights into how my activity levels have evolved and identify key factors influencing these changes. Clear visualizations will illustrate trends and differences between the two periods, helping me make informed adjustments to my routine for maintaining or improving activity levels. Furthermore, this project will act as a case study, demonstrating how data analysis can yield valuable personal insights, potentially inspiring others to track and analyze their habits for better health outcomes.
